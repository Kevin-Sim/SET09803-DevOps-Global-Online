# SET09803 DevOps Global Online

Welcome to the GitHub page for SET09803 DevOps Global Online. GitHub contains all of the material for the module with the exception of the end of Unit Tests which you will find on the Moodle page.

Before commencing the module you should view the introduction to the module on Moodle

You should attempt to complete the labs individually which will give you the skills to contribute towards your group coursework 

Please note that the material has been adapted from a previous module named software engineering methods (SEM). Some of the lab material may refer to SEM and there may be hyperlinks that point to that GitHub page. If you come across any errors please let me know. Also some of the screenshots may be out of date as IntelliJ gets updated on a regular basis but it should be straightforward to adapt to newer versions.
